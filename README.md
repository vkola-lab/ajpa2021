# Deep learning driven quantification of interstitial fibrosis in kidney biopsies 
# Introduction
This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a deep learning framework for classification of trichrome-stained whole-slide images (WSIs). It is the code for the paper Deep learning driven quantification of interstitial fibrosis in kidney biopsies

We use WSIs obtained from The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (OSUWMC) and Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) respectively to evaluate the proposed model.

The Class Activation Map (CAM) is used to visualize which regions located by the model contributes to fibrosis level
